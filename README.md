# ContrerasJResturantPickerAPI
In this challenge the user is given 3 options of foods to choose from one being a random resturant to go too, dessert locations to go too and a fastfood category that gives them different fast foods. They are able to type in one of the three and are given a result from the options they choose and the result is random everytime.

First the will push F5 so that is debugs the code and makes sure the code is running, they will then get the local host url and paste it into postman so that the dated is being transferred to postman.

Example: https://localhost:7228/GreaterThanLessThan/greatorless


Peer reviewed by: Madeline Gowan - The code runs as intended. I like the use of Models, especially since we just learned them! And I like the categories--having vague terms like dessert and fast food allows more options, wheras I went a bit more specific with coffee, pizza, etc. Good work!
